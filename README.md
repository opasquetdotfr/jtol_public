# Jtol is a Max/MSP library for rhythm and pattern generation using a tree structure.

Jtol is built and used by jt rinker and olivier pasquet. It is a library dedicated to real-time pattern generation and can be applied to architectural design, music, dance; and everything requiring constructed evolution in space and time. It deals with multi-scaling and multi-dimensions where rhythm is considered to be a skeleton onto which everything else is attached (pitches, paramsâ€¦).  Jtol was first programmed in python in max with the help of bertrand nouvel. It gathered data structures similar to the jitter library but with a nested architecture. A newer version is now using the bach library and still runs in max. It has nevertheless been programmed in order to always be able to easily get rid of the bach library. It is inspired by libraries like athenaCL, numpy, scipy, abjad, pyevolve, pwgl and open music. Some purely generative music devices will soon come for max for live.

For Max 8.2.2 and bach 0.8.1 beta.

### Examples

#### jtol.bach.ratio

#### jtol.bach.henon

`jtol.bach.henon` is one of the available generators. It performs the [Henon map](en.wikipedia.org), a nonâ€‘linear twoâ€‘dimensional discrete deterministic dynamical system.

For most generators, each parameter can be a [scalar](en.wikipedia.org), a [vector](en.wikipedia.org), or a [tree](en.wikipedia.org). This allows cell-by-cell and step-by-step control for the generated [forms](en.wikipedia.org).

#### jtol.bach.play

`jtol.bach.play` converts ratios from `jtol.bach2score` into millisecond timings and outputs corresponding time-delayed bangs when a `play` message is received.

#### jtol.bach.dur

`jtol.bach.dur` retrieves all durations of a jtol tree.

#### jtol.bach2score

`jtol.bach2score` gathers a time tree representation for bach.score. The time signature is calculated from the incoming tree and the note value.

---

#### jtol.bach.reduce

`jtol.bach.reduce` reduces the depth of trees. For example:
